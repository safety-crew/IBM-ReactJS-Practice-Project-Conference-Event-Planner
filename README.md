# Practice Project: Conference Event Planner
### Understand the task
Alejandre manages a venue for business conferences. Her parent company, "BudgetEase" wants to hire you to develop a website so BudgetEase customers can price their conference events easily.

The application's requirements include allowing users to select and price the rooms in the conference center, add-on selections, like microphones and projectors, and meals for a given number of guests.

The BudgetEase conference expense planner features will include:

- A dynamic user interface that updates in real time based on user selections
- Components for venue selection, add-ons, and meal options
- Redux integration using Redux Toolkit to manage state changes
- Redux slices to manage different section states
- Display selected items and their costs with a table in a pop-up window
- Calculate and display subtotals and total costs based on user selections

### Learning objectives
After completing this lab, I was able to:

- Create React components: Create functional React components using component composition and nesting.
- Manage states with hooks: Implement React Hooks, specifically the useState and useEffect hooks. I used hooks to manage component-level state and control the visibility of elements.
- Integrate Redux: Integrate Redux within an application using Redux concepts like actions, reducers, and the store.
- Render dynamic data: Dynamically render data fetched from an array of objects into the UI. I mapped over arrays to generate lists of components.
- Handle events using conditional rendering: Handle user events such as button selection and trigger corresponding actions.

### Project tasks
- Setup the project environment
- Review the structure of the ConferenceEvent.jsx component
- Review the code for the venue module
- Combine Redux with components to manage updates and state changes
- Add logic to calculate subtotals and total cost
- Make a dynamic table to show chosen products, displaying the item name, unit cost, quantity, and overall costs for that item
- Create a web design for a comfortable user experience
- Deploy your website to a public hosting service
